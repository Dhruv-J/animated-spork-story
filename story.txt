There once was a man named Steve. Steve had infinite land around him, and he could do as he chose with it. The world was his to mold, and the possibilities were endless. He started off by gathering some wood.

Then he used these wood to make a place to stay. He named that a house.

Several hours passed, he quickly got bored and decided on pursuing a new task; wrestling wild animals. 

One day, he went out to wrestle this big bear and got badly injured. Unfortunately, he was stranded. There were no hospitals in sight. He had to rely on his survival skills.

He had to start from the ground up, collecting wood slowly, and building a new house. Eventually, he found a way out of his desolate condition. While wandering one day, he caught a glimpse of his old house. Though it was quite decayed, he was easily able to fix it it with his new strength and perseverance. Steve watched the sun set, happy that he was now stronger than ever before.
